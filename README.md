# Tic Tac Toe

A project built with react based on the classic tic-tac-toe game.

The aim of this small project was to introduce me to React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is often used for single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. This project, which involved following a tutorial, has provided learning towards some of the basics of React that I have not used before.

## Using the program
Clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:domw30/tic-tac-toe.git
```
Change directory into the tic-tac-toe directory.
```
cd tic-tac-toe
```
Run the scripts using npm start ([node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required):
```
npm start
```
Visit localhost:3000 in the browser.
